# CR3BP-App
Application to design trajectories of desired itineraries in the CR3BP. Also included is an application that performs the calculation for ballistic capture maneuvers in the BR4BP. 

Main.mlapp is the primary application that enables the design of trajectories. It is an entirely self contained MATLAB interactive app. To run the code, simply download the application and run it from any MATLAB version R2018a or later.

Ballistic_Capture.mlapp is the application which performs ballistic capture trajectory computation in the Sun-Earth-Moon system. To run the code, simply download the application and run it from any MATLAB version R2018a or later.

Both applications require the included .csv files for visualizations. If a new .csv file is desired, run the ZeroVelBouhdaryCalc.mlx code.
